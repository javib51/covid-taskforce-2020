A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Quick Start
You can use the apk that you can find on [releases](https://github.com/javib51/covid-taskforce-2020/releases/tag/v1.0.0). But if you want to run the app, you should have android sdk and flutter installed. Then:
```
cd app
flutter build apk
```
The app will be on `build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
